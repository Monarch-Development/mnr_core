## Monarch Framework [WIP]
_A Framework finally free from corruption and community driven_

### Why did I start writing scripts?
I started my hobby as a "developer" mainly for a few reasons:
- Create my own RP server.
- Disadvantage those who try to make money from users not providing them a well-made and carefully crafted product.
- Not follow the creators trends that they use for make more money by selling.

### Why did I decide to make a framework?
I've been in the FiveM community for almost two years now. During my experience I've noticed some things, the developers (not all but the majority) are driven to what they do just for the money and this makes them do also wrong things to make more earnings:
- Partner with random creators just to exchange members and customers
- Do giveaways even with creators you don't like to gain more visibility and money
- Devaluing or defaming others to steal their customers
- Make sponsors to random people in exchange of money or creator codes to earn from their sales
I half understand what drives them to do it and half I don't appreciate this reality because it is ethically wrong in my opinion. When you hold an important role you **MUST** be clear and honest with your community and when you offer a service or product you **MUST** support the product and commit to making it optimal for commercial use without bugs and provide user support. Since these things aren't done by the majority of creators nor by frameworks, I decided to do my part.

### Why choose Monarch?
I'm primarily a financially poor person, but ethically I can't force people to give me money for a game, nor do I have any reason to use them as pawns in my dirty game to make money. I offer you this:
- A product that will strive for modernity and maximum quality
- A product that will be updated over time
- A community that I hope will grow and be free from profit constraints
- **But above all** honesty and no twisted games. I don't want to wear a mask or recommend creators whose products aren't worth using in exchange of money. I want to do all this to use fame in a clean way to benefit those who work hard in this world and are often overlooked, for the safety of this community and of the users who spend money every day to be able to enjoy the game with friends.
